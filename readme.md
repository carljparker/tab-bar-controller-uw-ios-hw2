This project implements Homework 2 for the UW iOS app development class.

The project supports presenting red, green, and blue view controllers
and keeping counts of how many times each of these have been presented.
It also supports an action sheet that enables the user to reset these
counts.

In addition to the above functionality, the project also supports
presenting a View Controller with a random color. The random color is
chosen using an extension method to UIColor that was provided with the
homework assignment.

I implemented the random color support quickly on the day the assignment
was due. I did not provide functionality to count the number of times
the random color has been presented--although the project does
demonstrate how to do this for the pre-set colors. My primary goal with
implementing random color support was to demonstrate that I could
leverage the extension method provided.
